*Part 1: Short Answer Questions*

1. *Problem Definition*
- *Predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days of discharge*: This problem aims to identify patients who are likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. This can help healthcare providers target interventions to reduce readmissions and improve patient outcomes.
- *Objectives*:
    1. *Identify high-risk patients*: Develop a model that can identify patients who are at high risk of readmission.
    2. *Develop a predictive model*: Create a model that can predict the likelihood of readmission for each patient.
    3. *Implement evidence-based practices*: Use the model to inform clinical decision-making and reduce readmissions.
- *Stakeholders*: Hospital administrators, clinicians, patients, and families are all stakeholders in this problem.
- *KPI*: The key performance indicator for this problem is the readmission rate within 30 days of discharge.

2. *Data Collection & Preprocessing*
- *Data sources*: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), claims data, and other relevant data sources can be used to collect data for this problem.
- *Potential bias*: Sampling bias, selection bias, and information bias are all potential biases that can affect the accuracy of the model.
- *Preprocessing steps*: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering are all important preprocessing steps that can help improve the accuracy of the model.

3. *Model Development*
- *Gradient Boosting*: Gradient Boosting is a popular machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. It works by combining multiple weak models to create a strong predictive model.
- *Hyperparameters*: The number of trees, learning rate, and other hyperparameters can be tuned to optimize the performance of the model.

4. *Evaluation & Deployment*
- *Evaluation metrics*: Accuracy, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) are all important evaluation metrics for this problem.
- *Concept drift*: Concept drift refers to changes in the underlying distribution of the data over time. This can affect the accuracy of the model and require retraining.
- *Technical challenge*: Scalability is an important technical challenge for this problem, as the model needs to be able to handle large amounts of data and make predictions in real-time.

*Part 2: Case Study Application*

- *Problem Scope*: The problem scope includes identifying high-risk patients, developing a predictive model, and implementing evidence-based practices to reduce readmissions.
- *Data Strategy*: A comprehensive data strategy is needed to collect and preprocess data for this problem. This includes identifying relevant data sources, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- *Model Development*: The model development process involves selecting a suitable algorithm, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating the performance of the model.
- *Deployment*: The model needs to be deployed in a way that integrates with existing clinical workflows and decision-making processes.

*Part 3: Critical Thinking*

- *Ethics & Bias*: Bias in the data or model can lead to unfair treatment of certain patient groups. Strategies to mitigate bias include collecting diverse data, using fairness metrics, and ensuring transparency and accountability.
- *Trade-offs*: There are trade-offs between model interpretability and accuracy, as well as between different evaluation metrics. These trade-offs need to be carefully considered when developing and deploying the model.

*Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram*

- *Reflection*: Reflecting on the problem-solving process can help identify areas for improvement and inform future projects.
- *Workflow Diagram*: A workflow diagram can help illustrate the different stages of the problem-solving process and ensure that all steps are completed.
