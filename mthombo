Defect Lifecycle in Software Testing
The defect lifecycle refers to the stages a defect goes through from its identification to its resolution. Understanding the defect lifecycle is crucial for effective defect management.

Purpose and Importance
The defect lifecycle serves several purposes:

- *Ensures defects are tracked and resolved*: Provides a clear process for identifying, reporting, and resolving defects.
- *Improves software quality*: Helps ensure that defects are identified and fixed, resulting in higher-quality software.
- *Enhances collaboration*: Facilitates communication and collaboration among team members, including developers, testers, and stakeholders.

Early Defect Identification
Early defect identification is crucial for software quality because it:

- *Reduces costs*: Fixing defects early in the development cycle is less expensive than fixing them later.
- *Improves quality*: Identifying defects early helps ensure that the software meets the required standards and is delivered on time.
- *Enhances customer satisfaction*: Delivering high-quality software that meets customer expectations leads to increased customer satisfaction.

Methods for Identifying Defects
Several methods can be used to identify defects in software, including:

- *Testing*: Various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
- *Code reviews*: Reviewing code to identify potential defects and improve code quality.
- *Static analysis*: Analyzing code without executing it to identify potential defects.
- *User feedback*: Gathering feedback from users to identify defects and areas for improvement.

Logging Defects
Logging defects is a critical aspect of effective defect management. It involves:

- *Documenting defect details*: Recording detailed information about the defect, including its description, steps to reproduce, and expected results.
- *Assigning defect priority*: Assigning a priority level to the defect based on its severity and impact.
- *Tracking defect status*: Tracking the status of the defect throughout its lifecycle, from identification to resolution.
