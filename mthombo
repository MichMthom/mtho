*1. Understand different types of software testing and their significance.*

Software testing types include:
- Functional testing (unit, integration, system, acceptance)
- Non-functional testing (performance, security, usability)
- Each type ensures software quality, reliability, and performance.

*2. Differentiate between functional and non-functional testing.*

- Functional testing: Verifies software meets requirements (what the software does).
- Non-functional testing: Evaluates performance, security, usability, and other aspects (how the software performs).

*3. Learn the key differences between unit testing and integration testing.*

- Unit testing: Tests individual code units (methods, classes).
- Integration testing: Tests interactions between code units.

*4. Explore system and acceptance testing and their role in software quality.*

- System testing: Verifies entire system's functionality.
- Acceptance testing: Ensures software meets user requirements and is ready for deployment.

*5. Identify common types of non-functional testing and their importance.*

- Performance testing: Evaluates system performance under load.
- Security testing: Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.
- Usability testing: Ensures user-friendly interface and experience.
- Compatibility testing: Verifies software works on different platforms and environments.
